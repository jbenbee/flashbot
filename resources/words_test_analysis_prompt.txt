Correct the following translations with the least possible modifications.
The correction should maintain the intended meaning of the sentence while fixing the grammar and using the suggested word.
Explain every correction.

Translation: I shared my meal with a friend. -> Compartí mi comida con una amiga
Suggested word: compartir
Correction: Your translation is correct, well done!

Translation: I spread the news among my friends. -> Disolví la noticia entre mis amigos
Suggested word: difundir
Correction: Difundí la noticia entre mis amigos.
Explanation of corrections:
- "Disolví" is not an appropriate word in this context. It means "dissolved," and it does not convey the intended meaning of spreading news. "Difundí" is the correct word to use, as it means "I spread."
- No other corrections were necessary

Translation: I have taken a leave of absence from work for one week. -> Ho prendo un asperrativa a una settimana
Suggested word: aspettativa
Correction: Ho preso un'aspettativa per una settimana.
Explanation of corrections:
- "Ho prendo" has been corrected to "Ho preso". In Italian, "prendo" is the present tense, while "preso" is the past tense, which is the appropriate tense for describing the action of taking a leave of absence that has already occurred.
- "un asperrativa" has been corrected to "un'aspettativa". "Asperrativa" is a misspelling, and the correct term for "leave of absence" in Italian is "aspettativa". In addition, article "un" has been changed to "un'". In Italian, when a word ending with a vowel precedes a word starting with a vowel, an apostrophe (') is added to avoid a collision of vowel sounds. This is called an elision.
- "a una settimana" has been corrected to "per una settimana". In Italian when indicating a duration of time it is common to use "per" to mean "for". "A" is typically used to express a specific time or point in time. So "a una settimana" would suggest "at one week" rather than "for one week".

Translation: I hope you can make it to my party. -> Espero que puedas venir en mi fiesta.
Suggested word: venir
Correction: Espero que puedas venir a mi fiesta.
Explanation of corrections:
- "en mi fiesta" has been corrected to "a mi fiesta". The error in the original translation is the preposition "en," which is used incorrectly. In this context, "a" should be used to indicate the destination or purpose of attending the party. So, "a mi fiesta" is the correct prepositional phrase to convey that someone is coming to the party.
- No other corrections were necessary

Translation: I hope at least you can come to the party. -> Spero che almeno arrivi alla festa
Suggested word: almeno
Correction: Spero che almeno tu possa venire alla festa.
Explanation of corrections:
- "tu possa" is added to maintain the intended meaning of the sentence. In the original sentence, "can" was used to express the ability to come to the party, so "tu possa" is necessary in Italian to convey the same idea.
- "arrivi" (arrive) is substituted with "venire" (come) to express the ability to come to the party.

Translation: I finished my degree two years ago. -> Termino una carrera dos años
Suggested word: terminar
Correction: Terminé la carrera hace dos años.
Explanation of corrections:
- "Termino" has been corrected to "Terminé". The original sentence is in the past tense, so the verb should also be in the past tense to indicate that the action of finishing the degree is completed in the past.
- "una carrera" has been corrected to "la carrera". The original sentence talks about a specific degree, so "la" is used to indicate "the"
- "dos años" has been corrected to "hace dos años" to correctly indicate "two years ago." The addition of "hace" is essential to convey the time frame in the sentence.
