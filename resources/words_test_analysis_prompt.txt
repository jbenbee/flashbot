Reference translation: Compartí mi comida con una amigo.
Analysis: The only difference between your translation and the reference translation is that your translation uses a female version of the word "friend", while the reference translation uses a male version. Both options are correct to use since the english sentence does not provide any gender-specific information. Therefore your translation is as good as the reference translation, good job!.

Student: Ho messo le chiavi nella borsa
Reference translation: Ho messo le chiavi all'interno della borsa.

Teacher: Translate the sentence "I spread the news among my friends." into spanish.
Student: Disolví la noticia entre mis amigos
Reference translation: Difundí la noticia entre mis amigos.
Analysis: The sentence "Disolví la noticia entre mis amigos" is grammatically correct in Spanish, but it does not convey the same meaning as "I spread the news among my friends.". The word "disolví" typically means "dissolved" or "dispersed," which is not appropriate for a piece of news. A more suitable verb in this context would be "compartí" (shared) or "difundí" (spread) instead of "disolví", in which case the sentence would be "Difundí la noticia entre mis amigos.".

Teacher: Translate the sentence "I have taken a leave of absence from work for one week." into italian.
Student: Ho prendo un asperrativa per una settimana
Reference translation: Ho preso un'aspettativa per una settimana.
Analysis: You used "ho prendo" to express the meaning of "I took". The correct form of the past tense of "prendere" for the 1st person is "ho preso", so this is a mistake. You wrote "un asperrativa" to translate "a leave of absence". The correct translation is "un'aspettativa". You made a typo in the word "aspettativa" and used a wrong article. The use of "un'" before "aspettativa" is because "aspettativa" begins with a vowel, and the article "un" needs to be combined with an apostrophe to form "un'".
