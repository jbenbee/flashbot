I was asked to perform a translation of a sentence into {{lang}} using word (phrase) "{{word}}".
Please rate my translation on a scale from 1 to 5 according to how grammatically correct and natural it is. Using transliteration is allowed and is not considered to be a mistake.
1 means the translation has major mistakes, 5 means that the translation is correct and it could have been written by a native speaker.
Justify your score in one sentence.
If the translation has mistakes, explain to me why it is a mistake in this specific context. Describe which grammar rule should have been used and why. Remind me how this grammar rule should be used in this example. Add a short description of the grammar rule.
Show a translation where the identified mistakes are corrected and using the word (phrase) "{{word}}", is possible.
